# Docusaurus-TimeLine
 
Docusaurus uses the Infima framework for styling layouts. The components described here are entirely based on the Infima grid system. With this component, you can easily create timelines. It offers great flexibility to structure your content and create attractive, responsive layouts. Only the HTML skeleton of the timeline is not derived from the Infima CSS framework; however, it allows you to leverage the framework's power for customization. If you want to create beautiful timelines, this component will enable you to achieve that quickly and efficiently.
